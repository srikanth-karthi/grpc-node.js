# gRPC News Service with Node.js

This is a sample project demonstrating a gRPC-based News Service implemented in Node.js using Protocol Buffers.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=12.x)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grpc-news-service-node.git
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd grpc-news-service-node
   npm install
   \`\`\`

## Usage

1. Start the gRPC server:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`

   This will start the gRPC server for the News Service.

2. Access the gRPC methods:

   Use a gRPC client to interact with the implemented methods (\`GetAllNews\`, \`AddNews\`, \`DeleteNews\`) provided by the News Service.

   Example gRPC client code (Node.js):

   \`\`\`javascript
   // Your gRPC client code here to interact with the service
   \`\`\`

## gRPC Methods

The News Service supports the following gRPC methods:

- \`GetAllNews\`: Fetches all news items.
- \`AddNews\`: Adds a new news item.
- \`DeleteNews\`: Deletes a news item by ID.

## Folder Structure

- \`proto\`: Contains the Protocol Buffer file (\`news.proto\`) defining service and message definitions.
- \`src\`: Contains the server-side Node.js code implementing gRPC methods.
